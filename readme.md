2. **Google Chrome Browser**

4. WordPress site with webhook integration enabled.
5. **ngrok**

## **Usage**

### **1. Start the Flask Server**
Run the Flask server to listen for webhook events from WordPress:
```bash
python autopost.py
```

### **2. New Product Trigger**
Whenever a new product is added to WordPress:
1. WordPress sends a webhook payload to the Flask server.
2. The server fetches content from **Gemini API** using the product name.
3. Selenium opens Facebook and posts the generated content.

### **3. Example Workflow**
1. **Webhook Payload** (from WordPress):
   ```json
   {
       "product_name": "Awesome Product",
       "product_description": "This is a great product!"
   }
   ```
2. **Generated Facebook Post**:
   ```
   ðŸŽ‰ New Product Alert: Awesome Product
